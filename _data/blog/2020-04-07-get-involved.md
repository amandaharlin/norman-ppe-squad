This volunteer group was started to help spread useful information on what can be created and used at local health care centers. You can help by joining our efforts to fulfill requests for PPE for medical or other high-risk professionals.

## 1) Join our Facebook Groups

There are two groups, one for the production side, and one for the design side.

### Production focused group [(Norman / OKC PPE Squad)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1304999819692768/)

This group is only for local makers actively producing PPE or local organizations requesting PPE. It is focused on production, logistics, and organization.

### Design and discussion [(Norman / OKC PPE Thinkers and Talkers)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/217912735946956/)

This group is open for anyone who wants to discuss designs, improvement, resources available, or anything else that is not directly involved with actual production.



## 2) Sign up to fulfill requests and/or deliver PPE items

### Current designs

Current approved design files are available on [Approved PPE Designs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mnmvZMp3rLKPitnF1Zv6zsKCqj1d0pIF)-- all designs are “use at your own risk” and the user / organization using them assume all liability for their use in any situation.

Don’t self-start and modify anything special, because this delays delivery and acceptance.

### Current requests

Current production requests and a list of who has committed to making them is available on [Production Requests](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/136LL4FxBY360ruetwlhCqy5z1URTNFllhwNeuIRCv9A/edit?fbclid=IwAR05XKMuMhmqDRj7v7Y_ZHW4cP1e03g09DPyYqyzCLhRN3x14cjBdS3zr8k#gid=378622234). There are tabs for each request.

#### Prusa RC-3 Modified Design

* Face shield head mount + bottom reinforcement (2 parts)
* PETG is recommended. PLA will also work. The material should be add-in free, meaning no glitter, special properties like carbon fiber, etc.
* Slicing parameters
* * Infill: 30%, although this is not critical.
  * Supports are not necessary unless stacked models are used (not supplied)
  * Perimeter: 3 recommended

#### Face mask

* Three parts, all on the google drive
* PETG or PLA, no preference
* Slicing parameters:
* * Infill: 20% or 30%, not critical
  * Supports: no.
  * Perimeter: 3 recommended

### Handling Parts

* If using PLA, baking to harden is not needed.
* Items should be placed in plastic bags if available to keep dust and dirt off them. A bag can contain more than one shield set, but the lower and upper parts should be together so a bag is a complete set of parts needed for assembly.
* Note: while we should minimize unprotected handling of the parts, the requirement is that all parts will go through a sterilization process at the destination site, and it is their responsibility to ensure this happens.

### Collection and Delivery Plan

* Be safe. Minimize contact with others as usual.
* For any destination, we will try to collect drop off contact and location data, and keep this in a spreadsheet.
* For now, this is very ad-hoc.



## 3) Purchase or Donate Printing Supplies

We are in need of:

* PETG (preferred) or PLA, 1.75 mm, no “add-ins” like glitter or similar. Unopened packages preferred.
* 0.5 mm to 1.0mm PETG clear plastic sheets at least 16x10 inches. Other types can be used, including transparency film, but for critical care in infectious areas, 16x10 inches is the required size.



## 4) Support Volunteer Efforts with a monetary gift

Contact Michael Graff or Blake Kirkpatrick for more information if you'd like to contribute a gift so the volunteers can purchase supplies. The OKC/Norman PPE Squad is a group of volunteers coordinating efforts across the OKC metro area. The OKC/Norman PPE Squad is not a non-profit, NGO, or business entity. Consult your tax professional if you have any questions.
