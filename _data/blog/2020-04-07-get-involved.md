This volunteer group was started to help spread useful information on what can be created and used at local health care centers. 

# Join our Facebook Groups

There are two groups, one for the production side, and one for the design side.

## Production focused group

[Norman / OKC PPE Squad](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1304999819692768/)

This group is only for those making or consuming items, after designs are approved by health care providers for use in their areas. It is focused on production, logistics, and organization.

## Design and discussion

[Norman / OKC PPE Thinkers and Talkers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/217912735946956/)

This group is open for anyone who wants to discuss designs, improvement, resources available, or anything else that is not directly involved with actual production.

Purchase or Donate Printing Supplies

We are in need of:

* PETG (preferred) or PLA, 1.75 mm, no “add-ins” like glitter or similar. Unopened packages preferred.\
* 0.5 mm to 1.0mm PETG clear plastic sheets at least 16x10 inches. Other types can be used, including transparency film, but for critical care in infectious areas, 16x10 inches is the required size.
